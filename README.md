3 Gears
==================================================

The goal of this project is to make a gears animation with three different technologies.  So far I have animations in [PaperJS](http://paperjs.org/) and [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/).  I'm still working on [Raphaël](http://raphaeljs.com) and I'm still trying to work out a couple of bugs in my trigonometry.
